## 3. Architecture

### 3.1. Overview

The application employs a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

- **Model:** Handles data and business logic.
- **View:** Contains FXML files that define the user interface layout.
- **Controller:** Manages user interactions and updates the view based on changes in the model.

### 3.2. Component Breakdown

- **Model Classes:** Manage data operations including regex processing, list management, and file handling.
- **Controller Class:** (TextProcessorController.java) Manages user actions and interactions with the model.
- **View (FXML):** Describes the UI components and their arrangement.

## 4. User Interface Design

### 4.1. Layout

- **Input Area:** Provides a text area for users to input data.
- **Regex Section:** Contains fields for entering regex patterns and replacement text.
- **Action Buttons:** Includes buttons for matching patterns, replacing text, and clearing fields.
- **Data Management:** Features text fields and buttons for managing data entries.
- **File Operations:** Offers buttons for saving and loading both list data and text data.

### 4.2. Styling

The application uses inline CSS for styling to ensure a visually consistent and appealing interface. Custom styles are applied to buttons and text fields to enhance user interaction and feedback.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1. Regex Processing

- **Pattern Matching:** Utilizes Javaâ€™s Pattern and Matcher classes for regular expression operations.
- **Text Replacement:** Performs replacements of matched patterns using String.replaceAll().

### 5.2. Data Management

- **Collection Type:** Utilizes ObservableList for maintaining a list of data.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implements functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items.

### 5.3. File Operations

- **Data Persistence:**
  - **Saving Data:** Serializes the data list to a file using FileWriter and BufferedWriter.
  - **Loading Data:** Reads data from a file using BufferedReader and updates the list.

- **Text File Operations:**
  - **Saving Text Data:** Writes processed text to a file using FileWriter.
  - **Loading Text Data:** Reads text data from a file using BufferedReader.

### 5.4. Error Handling

- Implements basic error handling mechanisms for file operations and regex processing to ensure the application can manage exceptions and provide appropriate user feedback.

## 6. Usage Instructions
